I wrote in [_How to Understand and Use Blockchain Technology to our Advantage_](https://medium.com/j29creative/how-to-understand-and-use-blockchain-technology-to-our-advantage-be5002f49bbf?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------) that a decentralized model of technology operations is a dominant force in this decade. This form of technology has come a long way since the release of [_Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System_](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) whitepaper by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) in 2007.

This article focuses on the utility of blockchain technology today, focusing on 2 concepts that have fascinated many people: -

*   Tokenization.
*   Non-Fungible Tokens.

I will present what [Bottomsup Perspectives](https://bottomsupperspective.com/) has researched, breaking them down into what they are and what we can do with them.

**What is Tokenization?**
=========================

Honestly, the core team in [Bottomsup Perspectives](https://bottomsupperspective.com/) has had a tough time deciphering what tokenization is.

These explanations tend to be technical in nature, and it presents a high barrier to entry of understanding. Consider the following from [mcafee.com](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-sg/security-awareness/cloud/tokenization-vs-encryption.html): -

> [Tokenization](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-sg/security-awareness/cloud/tokenization-vs-encryption.html) is the process of turning a meaningful piece of data, such as an account number, into a random string of characters called a token that has no meaningful value if breached. Tokens serve as a reference to the original data, but cannot be used to guess those values…. (it) does not use a mathematical process to transform the sensitive information into a token.

This is the standard explanation we found all over the internet. From there, we understood the importance of simplifying what we have learned through our research.

For the purposes of this article, we will reference tokens as individual packets of data.

**What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?**
========================================

I will address the definition of _non-fungible_ first.

Fungible refers to exchangeable. The $1 United States Dollar bill in your wallet is fungible with the $1 bill in my pocket. Exchanging yours for mine is an equal exchange of value.

[Fungibility is a property attribute](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fungible). It suggests that these things are the same. If you were to perform a copy & paste on one of your word documents, then you have created a fungible replicate. They are one and the same.

[Non-fungible means being unique](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nonfungible).

Because [Non-Fungible Token](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/)s on a [blockchain platform](https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain#:~:text=Blockchain%20is%20a%20system%20of,computer%20systems%20on%20the%20blockchain.) cannot be plagiarized (unlike our social media content or YouTube videos), it opens the door for digital assetization.

**Examples of NFTs as an Asset**
================================

Too many.

We can tokenize a GIF we create.

> Nyan Cat, a 2011-era GIF of a cat with a pop-tart body, sold for nearly [$600,000 in February](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html). And NBA Top Shot generated more than [$500 million in sales](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-dapper-labs-valuation-funding-round/7058307002/) as of late March. A single LeBron James highlight NFT fetched more than $200,000.

If you are a digital artist, the sky is the limit.

> Brands like Charmin and Taco Bell have auctioned off themed NFT art to raise funds for charity. Charmin dubbed its offering “NFTP” (non-fungible toilet paper), and Taco Bell’s NFT art sold out in minutes, with the highest bids coming in at 1.5 wrapped ether (WETH) — equal to $3,723.83 at the time of writing.

And how can we forget the famous [tweet-turned-NFT](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter)?

> After it spent just over two weeks on the market, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has sold his first tweet as an NFT for the weirdly specific figure of $2,915,835.47. The winning bidder was Sina Estavi, who had held the high bid since offering $2.5 million on March 6th.

[Jack Dorsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey) donated his proceeds to [GiveDirectly Africa fund](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/best-charities/givedirectly/).

**What can we do if we are interested in digital assetization?**
================================================================

First off, study and understand what it is.

2 properties make digital assetization appealing. These 2 attributes are best explained on [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [Mintable](https://mintable.app/): -

*   Conveyancing of copyright.
*   Resale commission.

These 2 attributes transform a packet of digital data into an asset.

Copyright is critical to assetization because you need to proof-of-production. You get to sell what is yours, and the value of your work is not diluted by massive copy & paste keyword functions by keyboard warriors.

And because these packets of data cannot be copied even by yourself, you can only make money through resale. A resale commission will be granted when existing holders of your work sell them to other folks.

It is a different business model.

**Takeaways**
=============

This is a new way to seek financial and commercial growth online.

Will tokenization and NFTs stay long enough to be anchored into our future? The core team at [Bottomsup Perspectives](https://bottomsupperspective.com/) isn’t smart enough to tell. However, we will actively experiment in the capacity of digital marketers.

The future can be exciting if we choose to be excited by it.
